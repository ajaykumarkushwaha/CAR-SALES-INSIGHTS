# CAR-SALES-INSIGHTS
The objective of this project is to design and develop a dynamic and interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard will visualize critical KPIs related to our car sales, helping us understand our sales performance over time and make data-driven decisions.
# KPIâ€™s Requirement
The dashboard should provide real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to our sales data. This will enable us to make informed decisions, monitor our progress, and identify trends and opportunities for growth.

## KPI Insights Conclusion:

The sales performance indicates strong growth overall. Year-to-date (YTD) total sales stand at **$371.2M**, with month-to-date (MTD) sales at **$54M**, reflecting a year-over-year (YOY) growth of **23.59%**. There is a notable increase of **$70.8M** when comparing current YTD sales to the previous year's YTD (PTYD) sales.

However, in terms of pricing, the average price has seen a slight decline. The YTD average price is **$28.0K**, compared to the MTD average of **$28.26K**. YOY growth in the average price has decreased by **0.79%**, and the difference between the YTD and PTYD average price is negative, at **($223.5)**, indicating that the current average price is slightly lower than last year.

For cars sold, the YTD total is **13.3K**, with **1.9K** sold this month. The YOY growth in cars sold is promising at **19.73%**, with **2.62K** more cars sold compared to the previous YTD.

In conclusion, while sales volumes have improved significantly, the negative difference in average price warrants attention to ensure that profitability is maintained along with the growing sales figures.
